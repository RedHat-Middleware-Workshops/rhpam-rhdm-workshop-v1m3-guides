# 1. Introduction

This is a Case Management lab in which will implement a Credit Card Dispute case.
The process will use `BPMN2` constructs like `Milestones`, `User Tasks`, `Gateways`, combined with decision-based routing based on `Business Rules Tasks`.

It introduces the dynamic concepts of the Red Hat Process Automation Manager case management support, like `autostart semantics` and `casefile-based milestone completion`.

**Topics covered in this module:**

* How to **author cases** in Red Hat Process Automation Manager;
* How to define and **create domain models** using the Data Modeler.
* How to **associate automated decision** logic with our cases.
* How to **implement milestones** completion logic taking benefit of the decision engine.
* How to **create forms** with the Form Modeller.
* How to **deploy the project** to the Execution Server.
* How to **execute** the end-to-end case.
