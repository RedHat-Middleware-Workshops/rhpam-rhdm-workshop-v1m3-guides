# Introduction

This is a Case Management lab in which will implement a Credit Card Dispute case.
The process will use `BPMN2` constructs like `Milestones`, `User Tasks`, `Gateways`, combined with decision-based routing based on `Business Rules Tasks`.

It introduces the dynamic concepts of the Red Hat Process Automation Manager case management support, like `autostart semantics` and `casefile-based milestone completion`.
